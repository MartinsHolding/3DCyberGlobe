## ⚡ Core Features

* **Global Data Mesh:** Procedurally generated icosahedron globe infrastructure with dynamic wireframe rendering.
* **Real-time Stream Simulation:** Visualizes packet transfers using 3D Cubic Bézier curves to represent data origin and destination points.
* **Zero-Latency Engine:** Built with pure ES6+ JavaScript and **Three.js (WebGL)**, optimized for rock-solid 60FPS performance.
* **Cyber-HUD:** Advanced overlay displaying real-time system telemetry, simulated latency spikes, and packet throughput.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Graphics:** Three.js (Low-level WebGL wrapper)
* **Frontend:** HTML5 / CSS3 (Neon-glow post-processing effects)
* **Architecture:** Modular ES6 via Import Maps (No bundler required for instant deployment)

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy
This visualizer was engineered to demonstrate how complex buffer geometries and vertex manipulation can transform raw numerical streams into an aesthetic digital experience. Every arc on the globe represents a "digital event" captured from the global backbone.

## 📈 Development Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Integration with live WebSocket APIs (e.g., Bitcoin mempool or Global Flight Data).
- [ ] **Phase 3:** WebXR implementation for Meta Quest & Vision Pro support.
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Advanced Bloom and Glitch post-processing shaders.
